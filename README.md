[A simple HTML version](https://archive-simple-html-v1--bookcricket.netlify.com/)    
This version has all the required functionality (at least at this point of time) but the UI is just simple HTML - absolutely no CSS beautification work at all.   
[Browser console version](https://archive-console-game-v0--bookcricket.netlify.com/)    
This version was the most simplest with only a couple of buttons to trigger the game play and most of the output seen in the browser console.

### Note
Works best on large screen devices only. I'll be working on making this more responsive.
